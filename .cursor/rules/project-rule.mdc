## Project rules

- Use pnpm instead of npm for package management
- Avoid casting in typescript and try to use proper types from the @types library. Search in npm to find proper library under @types to use if necessary.
- Use latest docs from https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs for guidance on using the ai sdk library and use the latest version of the library.
- When fixing tests, make sure to reuse types defined in the actual component it is testing to fix linting errors.
